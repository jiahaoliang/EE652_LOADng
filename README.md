# [LOADng](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-clausen-lln-loadng-12)  Implememntation on Contiki OS

## TO DO (which we no longer work on)
1. work with rerr
2. update route by seqno
3. weak link & blacklist

## How To Use
1. contiki-2.7.zip is the Contiki OS we were working on. Please unzip it to the home/contiki folder.  
2. Copy & paste `route.c, route.h, route-discovery.c, route-discovery.h, mesh.c` to `~/contiki/core/net/rime` folder, replacing original files.  
3. Copy & paste `uip-over-mesh.c` to  `~/contiki/core/net` folder, replacing original file.  
4. Run following commandlines to test Rime with LOADng,   
 ```  
 cd ~/contiki/examples/rime  
 ```  
 ```
 make TARGET=sky example-mesh
 ```
5. Test it under Cooja, add a number of nodes programmed with `example-mesh.sky` 
6. "click button" on one of the nodes, it sends "Hello" message to node 1.1 with multihop.

NOTE: All *.backup files are unchanged from original Contiki OS.

*route.c, route-discovery.c* are files we are supposed to work on.
